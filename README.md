# XlinkCyNET

XlinkCyNET is an open-source Java plugin that generates residue-to-residue connections provided by XL-MS in protein interaction networks. Importantly, it provides an interactive interface for the exploration of cross-links and offers various options to display protein domains. XlinkCyNET works well in complex networks containing thousands of proteins.

A video demonstrating how the application works can be found on the software website (https://www.theliulab.com/software/xlinkcynet).
A detailed tutorial, which explains step by step the functionality of all parameters is available at Protocol Exchange (http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.pex-1172/v1).

Features:

↪ Visualize protein-protein interaction network based on cross-linking mass spectrometry data

↪ Apply a residue-to-residue layout to a Cytoscape interaction network

↪ Annotate protein domains to all nodes in the network
